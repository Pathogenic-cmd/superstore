# Product Display Bot - Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up and run the Product Display Bot on either Telegram or WhatsApp.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Basic understanding of Python
- For Telegram: A Telegram account and bot token
- For WhatsApp: A Twilio account with WhatsApp API access

## Installation Steps

1. **Create a new directory for your project**:
   ```
   mkdir product_display_bot
   cd product_display_bot
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```
   pip install python-telegram-bot twilio
   ```

3. **Create the required folder structure**:
   ```
   mkdir images
   ```

4. **Save the main script** as `product_bot.py`

5. **Add sample product images to the `images` folder**:
   - Place images named `headphones.jpg`, `smartwatch.jpg`, and `earbuds.jpg` in the `images` folder
   - Or update the product catalog with your own product images

## Setting Up Telegram Bot

1. **Create a new Telegram bot**:
   - Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Send the command `/newbot` and follow the instructions
   - BotFather will give you a bot token - save this for later

2. **Configure your bot**:
   - Edit the `config.ini` file (created on first run)
   - Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the token from BotFather

3. **Run the bot**:
   ```
   python product_bot.py
   ```
   - Choose option 1 for Telegram

4. **Test your bot**:
   - Open Telegram and search for your bot by username
   - Start a chat and send the command `/start`
   - Then send `/products` to view the product catalog

## Setting Up WhatsApp Bot

1. **Create a Twilio account**:
   - Sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
   - Activate and configure the WhatsApp Sandbox

2. **Get your Twilio credentials**:
   - Locate your Account SID and Auth Token in the Twilio dashboard
   - Note your Twilio WhatsApp number

3. **Configure your bot**:
   - Edit the `config.ini` file (created on first run)
   - Fill in your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and WhatsApp number

4. **Important for WhatsApp image sending**:
   For the WhatsApp bot to send images, you need to:
   - Host your images on a publicly accessible server
   - Update the `image_url` in the code to point to your hosted images
   - For testing, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a temporary public URL

5. **Run the bot**:
   ```
   python product_bot.py
   ```
   - Choose option 2 for WhatsApp
   - Follow the prompts to send messages to a specific number

## Customizing Product Catalog

The bot creates a sample `products.json` file on first run. You can edit this file to add your own products:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product Name",
    "description": "Product description",
    "price": 99.99,
    "image_path": "images/product_image.jpg"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing images**: Ensure all referenced images exist in the correct path
2. **WhatsApp image not sending**: Verify your image URLs are publicly accessible
3. **Authentication errors**: Double-check your API tokens and credentials
